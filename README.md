# mlops-spam-classifier-end-to-end-project
Build first end-to-end MLOps project with DVC, Git, and ML


This repository contains my first complete end-to-end MLOps project.

Key highlights:
- Implemented a full ML workflow including data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.
- Integrated DVC for **data versioning**, experiment tracking, and reproducible pipelines.
- Used Git for source control and project version management.
- Applied core ML concepts and built models that are fully reproducible and trackable.
- Setup DVC remote storage on S3 for storing datasets and model artifacts.
- Configured pipeline automation using `dvc.yaml` stages and DVCLive for live metric tracking.

This project demonstrates the combination of ML engineering, version control, and MLOps best practices for reproducible, maintainable ML workflows.
